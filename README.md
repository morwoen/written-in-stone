# Written In Stone

A survival game where your abilities change after every 10 enemies are killed. You have to gather **rocks** from around the world to create **stones** (or kill bosses and level up) and use them to write your abilities on them in order to persist them.

Explore the map and try to survive while building your arsenal of active and passive abilities. Beware the enemies! They are getting some special abilities as well!
